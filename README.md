- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jojo-d3126
- ðŸ‘€ I'm interested in discrete electronics design coupled with embedded processors. I have a long career in this including aerospace, industrial electronics, motors and drives, and instrumentation.
- ðŸŒ± I'm learning how to write better code. I do a reasonably good job now but that learning never ends.
